# Simple NN classification algorithm using Local Binary Pattern histograms

This repository contains a simple nearest neighbour classification algorithm
for an image dataset, based on LBP histograms.
It can be used e.g. to find out how LBP works, or as a baseline algorithm to
compare against your own algorithm.
